[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/pxt-microbit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/pxt-microbit)

*This branch contains the latest development of the current production version (v0.x). If you are interested in the coming version, v1, which is [currently in beta](https://makecode.com/blog/microbit/v1-beta), please go to the [v1 branch](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/tree/v1).*

This target allows you to program a [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) using 
PXT ([Microsoft Programming Experience Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt)).

## Issue tracking

Please add an issue if you discover an (unreported) bug.

## Local server

The local server lets you to run the editor and serve the documentation from your own computer.

### Setup   
This section explains how to setup your development environment for pxt-microbit, whether that be to run a copy locally or to make source changes.    
Note that pxt-microbit can not be run without its main dependancy, [pxt](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt). Below explains how to setup both.      

The following commands perform a one-time setup after synching the repo on your machine.
* Note for any editing of the `.cpp` files, Yotta must be installed. To do so, follow the instructions on [their site](http://docs.yottabuild.org/).
* Install node.js 8.9.4 or higher.
* Install requirements for [pxt](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt). Note the v0 branch must be used for pxt-microbit (add ``sudo`` for Mac/Linux shells).
```
npm install -g jake
npm install -g typings
```

* [Clone the pxt repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) and set it to the v0 branch.
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/pxt
cd pxt
git checkout v0
```

* Install the pxt dependencies.
```
npm install
typings install
jake
cd ../
```

* [Clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-microbit
cd pxt-microbit
```
* install the PXT command line (add ``sudo`` for Mac/Linux shells).
```
npm install -g pxt
```
* install the dependencies
```
npm install

```

* Link pxt-microbit back to base pxt repo.
```
npm link ../pxt
```
Note the above command assumes the folder structure of   
```
       makecode
          |
  -----------------
  |               |
 pxt        pxt-microbit
 ```

### Running

Run this command from inside pxt-microbit to open a local web server (add ``sudo`` for Mac/Linux shells)
```
pxt serve --cloud
```
If the local server opens in the wrong browser, make sure to copy the URL containing the local token. 
Otherwise, the editor will not be able to load the projects.

If you need modify the `.cpp` files (and have installed yotta), enable yotta compilation by removing the ```--cloud``` flag (add ``sudo`` for Mac/Linux shells):
```
pxt serve
```

### Updates

To update your PXT version and make sure you're running the latest tools, run (add ``sudo`` for Mac/Linux shells):
```
pxt update
```
